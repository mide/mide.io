Hello World!

Thanks for checking out my website, I really appreciate the interest. As you
view the code please remember that I'm an operations engineer, not a web
developer.

If you're interested in the source, you may just want to browse the pre-jekyll
source at https://github.com/mide/mide.io.

Thanks!
Mark
