Ahoy!

You've reached the web page and blog of Mark, `W1IDE`.

I've been an amateur radio operator since November 2014 and I've loved every minute it. I guess you can say the hobby *resonates* with me.

When I saw that `W1IDE` was an available vanity callsign, I applied and got it. It's not a family call or anything like that, I was just able to fit my whole last name in there.

If you want to chat, you can find me on the [`W1BIM`](http://www.cmara.org/) repeater most often. Since I'm in central Massachusetts, you may hear me on some other local repeaters occasionally.

## Nets

I run *George's Old Timer's Net* alternating Mondays with [`NG1I`](http://qrz.com/db/ng1i/). The net is held most nights at 7:30 from the Paxton, MA [`W1BIM`](http://www.cmara.org/) repeater. Feel free to check in or listen; we try to keep conversations lively with nightly topics and trivia questions. It's a good time had by all.

## Clubs

I particpate in the following clubs:

* *(Club Secretary)* [Central Massachusetts Amateur Radio Association](http://www.cmara.org) (CMARA)
* *(Member)* [Worcester Emergency Communications Team](http://www.wect.org/) (WECT)
