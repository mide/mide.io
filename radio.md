Ahoy!

You've reached the web page and blog of Mark, [`W1IDE`](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3653670).

I've been an amateur radio operator since November 2014 and I've loved every minute it. I guess you can say the hobby *resonates* with me.

When I saw that [`W1IDE`](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3653670) was an available vanity callsign, I applied and got it. It's not a family call or anything like that, I was just able to fit my whole last name in there.

## Nets

I was the Monday night net control for the *George's Old Timer's Net* from March 2015 until March 2017. The net has been a great experience for me and I thank each and every one of my checkins. My family regularly listened to the net when I ran it, so it was an experience held by all. I do miss running the net, but I rest easy knowing that someone else has the opportunity to practice.

*George's Old Timer's Net* is held most nights at 7:30 from the Paxton, MA `W1BIM` repeater. Feel free to check in or listen; we try to keep conversations lively with nightly topics and trivia questions. It's a good time had by all. For a sample of the net, I did a writeup on my blog with a recording: [Running a Ham Radio Net]({% post_url 2015-10-19-running-a-ham-radio-net %}).
