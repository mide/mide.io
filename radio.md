Ahoy!

You've reached the web page and blog of Mark, `W1IDE`. I'm a member of the [Central Massachusetts
Amateur Radio Association](http://www.cmara.org) and the [Worcester Emergency Communications Team](http://www.wect.org/). 

You can find me on the [`W1BIM`](http://www.cmara.org/) repeater most often. I'm in central Massachusetts, so you may hear me on some other local repeaters occasionally. 

My call is a vanity call. It's not a family call or anything like that, I was just able to fit my whole last name in there.

I got my ticket in November of 2014 and I've been in love since. I guess you could say the hobby *resonates* with me.

## Nets

I am the Monday night net control for the *George's Old Timer's Net* which is held most nights at 7:30 from the Paxton, MA [`W1BIM`](http://www.cmara.org/) repeater. Feel free to check in or listen; we try to keep conversations lively with nightly topics and trivia questions. It's a good time had by all.
