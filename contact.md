## Email

Email is the best method of contact and if you wish to do so securely, you may use [my PGP public key](https://keybase.io/mide). Before trusting any key, be sure to verify its authenticity with the owner to prevent man in the middle attacks. You can reach me at `{{ site.email }}`.

## Social Networks

While I'm not huge into social networks, there are a few that I maintain a presence on.
