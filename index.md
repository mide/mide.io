## {{site.name_long}}

Hi there!

I'm a site reliability engineer from Massachusetts with a love for all things tech.

I work at [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) where weâ€™re on a mission to change the global economy.

I spend my free time on amateur radio, hosting a couple gaming servers, playing with GNU/Linux and practicing my golf swing.

Feel free to check out my blog and the links above.
