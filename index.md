# Mark Ide Jr

Hi there!

I'm a cloud operations engineer from Massachusetts with a love for all things tech.

I work at [Imprivata](https://www.imprivata.com/) where we enable healthcare professionals to access, communicate, and transact patient information, securely and conveniently.

I spend my free time on amateur radio, hosting a couple gaming servers, playing with GNU/Linux and practicing my golf swing.

Feel free to check out my blog and the links above.
